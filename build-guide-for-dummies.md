#Sparkflow ScreenShift for Dummies

So you just received your first **Sparkflow ScreenShift** unit and you're currently clueless on what to do first. This guide will walk you through the basics of building a **ScreenShift** format from scratch.

But before anything else. Let's try to quickly familiarize ourselves with the **Sparkflow Studio UI** first.

>This guide assumes that you already have a **Sparkflow** account setup by your producer and that you also already have a project setup inside the platform.

**1. Layers Panel**
All elements/components dragged to your stage will be shown and can also be re-arranged using this panel.

**2. Views Panel**
ScreenShift format has two views. 1 for collapsed and 1 for expanded. You have to provide separate layouts for the 2 views and this is the button to toggle between those view.

**3. Modes Panel**
The 2 views mentioned above are categorized into **3 modes** (desktop, tablet, and mobile). SS units are considered responsive so you have to setup **3 different layouts** to cater to different types of devices.

**4. Javascript Editor**
This button opens Sparkflow's own JS editor. Although technically you can code here, I highly suggest coding using your own code editor for safety purposes and to avoid losing your work.

**5. CSS Editor**
Like the JS editor above, I suggest sticking with your own code editor in coding your stylesheets.
